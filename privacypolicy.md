# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how this Discord bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and protects data when operating in Discord servers.

---

## 1. Data Collection

The Bot processes the following data only as required for its functionality:

- Message content (for prefix-based commands and moderation purposes)
- User IDs, Server IDs, and Channel IDs
- Member join and leave events
- Moderation-related events (such as bans, kicks, and logs)

The Bot does **not** read or store private (DM) messages.

---

## 2. Message Content Usage

Message content is processed **in real time only** to:
- Execute prefix-based commands (e.g., moderation or utility commands)
- Detect spam, malicious links, or rule violations
- Perform server security and moderation actions

Message content is **not stored, logged, or retained** after processing.

---

## 3. Data Storage

The Bot does not store message content or private messages.

Only minimal data such as configuration settings, server IDs, role IDs, and user IDs may be stored to ensure proper operation of moderation and security features.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

The Bot does not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.

All data processing occurs strictly within Discord and is used only for the intended moderation and security purposes.

---

## 5. User Control and Opt-Out

Server administrators can:
- Disable specific bot features
- Remove the Bot from their server at any time

Removing the Bot immediately stops all data processing.

---

## 6. Security

Reasonable measures are taken to protect all stored configuration data and prevent unauthorized access.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated revision date.

---

## 8. Contact

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the bot developer through the official support or contact channel.

# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how this Discord bot ("the Bot") collects, processes, and protects data while operating in Discord servers.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Bot is designed to provide automated moderation and server security features, including protection against spam, malicious links, invite links, prohibited language, and abusive behavior.

---

## 2. Data Processed

The Bot may process the following data **only when required for moderation and security purposes**:

- Message content (for automated moderation such as anti-spam, anti-link, anti-invite, and anti-swear filters)
- User IDs, Server IDs, Channel IDs
- Member moderation events (e.g., mutes, warnings, logs)

The Bot **does not read or store private (DM) messages**.

---

## 3. Message Content Usage

Message content is analyzed **in real time** to automatically detect:
- Spam and repeated messages
- Malicious or invite links
- Prohibited or abusive words
- Other rule violations configured by server administrators

When a violation is detected, the Bot may automatically take moderation actions such as deleting the message, muting the user, or logging the event.

**Message content is not stored, logged, or retained** after processing.

---

## 4. Data Storage

The Bot does **not** store message content.

Only minimal configuration data (such as server settings, enabled moderation rules, role IDs, and user IDs related to moderation actions) may be stored to ensure proper operation.

---

## 5. Data Sharing

The Bot does not sell, share, or transfer user data to any third parties.

All data processing occurs strictly within Discord and is limited to moderation and security functionality.

---

## 6. User Control and Opt-Out

Server administrators can:
- Enable or disable moderation features at any time
- Remove the Bot from their server

Removing the Bot immediately stops all data processing.

---

## 7. Machine Learning and AI

Message content and user data are **not used** to train machine learning models or AI systems.

---

## 8. Security

Reasonable technical measures are implemented to protect stored configuration data and prevent unauthorized access.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected by updating the revision date at the top of this document.

---

## 10. Contact

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the bot developer through the official support or contact channel.
